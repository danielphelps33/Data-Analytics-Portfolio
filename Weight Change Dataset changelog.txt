Weight Change Dataset changelog:

- wrapped text on header row so they are completely visible
- deleted participant id column as that is not relevant to the business task
- sorted by largest age to smallest to organize the dataset
- changed the color of the headers so it would be easier to read
- changed "Duration (weeks)" to "Duration of Study (weeks)" for clarity
- added conditional formatting to the "Weight Change" column where red represents weight gain and green represents weight loss
- added conditional formatting to the stress level column where green represents lower values and red represents higher ones, yellow is everything in between
- subtracted 1000 from the daily caloric deficit/surplus as anything below 1000 is a deficit, so the negative numbers are deficits, making the column easier to understand
- added formatting to the daily surplus/deficit to make it easier to parse at a glance, the higher the deficit the more green the cell is
- created a new sheet containing a pivotchart illustrating the importance of sleep quality in relation to stress levels, it also has an interactive filter so the viewer can see the relation at different physical activity levels
